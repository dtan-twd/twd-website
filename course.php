                    <p>This course represents the final phase in the project life cycle: testing, re-designing, and presenting web sites to the client. During the first part of the course students will design and develop a website for a client, and conduct the usability testing of their web sites using outside test subjects. Students will then analyze their test results, identify problems, and determine changes that are needed to meet usability objectives. Following an iterative design process, students will then use their findings to revise their web site designs before presenting the final product to their project sponsors. Additional topics will include search engine optimization, web analytics, web site maintenance and security, and presentation skills.</p>
					<p>Finally, students need to find work – whether employed or self-employed. This course will also include a module that provides practical help with resume writing, job interview skills, career planning, and starting up a consulting business.</p>
